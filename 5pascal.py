# Write a Python function called pascal() that prints out the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.
# The function accepts the number n, the number of rows to print
# Note : Pascal's triangle is an arithmetic and geometric figure first imagined by Blaise Pascal. 
# Each number is the two numbers above it added together.

# I understand what Pascal's triangle means (like the math when looking at the triangle itself),
# but I've been struggling to understand the equation even after a lot of reading.
# I've also been having issues after looking through the solution code
# and other codes for writing the pascal's triangle in Python.
# It is not clicking for me. 
# I'm hoping to try again after more rest, but I'm turning this in for the meantime.
